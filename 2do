[X] define environment via environment.php
    [X] consolidate public directories under a single URL
    [X] dictionary translations should affect according to current context (in which the controller, view or layour is being rendered)

[X] Handle exceptions at depth > 1 and in resources invoked from layout

[X] Better debugger
    [X] recursive blocks without the need to specify timer name (simply nest blocks)
        [X] collapsable in UI

    [X] built-in jQUERY

[X] request methods

[X] application init/fin
     Implemented as Loader component ... but reevaluated because all inits in the environment tree should be executed

     This doesn't leave me many options.  If I do it via a class, then said class must have a different name
     for each environment in the tree.

     So, finally, implemented as files.  application/control/initialize.php and application/control/finalize.php



[X] exception handler (with environment specific exceptions, response codes)
    [X] response object (code, headers, content-disposition, etc)
    Implemented via ExceptionHandler component

[X] languages

[X] Make a "public" directory, as to avoid direct access to application and component files

[X] Layouts
      As component
      Application::setLayout('X');
      Layout::set('varable', 'value')

      Define block contents from views:
        <? Layout::block('blockName') ?>
        <link>asdasds</link>
        <? Layout::endBlock('blockName') ?>
     (syntax from http://www.recessframework.org/page/new-layouts-blocks-assertive-templates-system is interesting )

      Within the layout:
        $this (the current layout) as variable
        Output a specific block contents  <?= $this->output('blockName') ?>
        Output a layout variable <?= $this->var ?>  OR <?= $this->get('var') ?>
        Parse asset paths (URLs)  <?= $this->URL('img/hello.jpg') ?>


[X] models/ORM

[/] navigation (linkTo, redirectTo, URL, etc)

[ ] authentication

[ ] authorization

[ ] output filters (doc, excel, pdf, etc)
